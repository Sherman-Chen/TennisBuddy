Established in 1901, this historic 21 court facility hosts professional level tournaments, leagues, camps, and recreational play for the city’s tennis community. Open 7 days a week, we hope you swing by the courts soon and discover this hidden gym for yourself! Please contact Facility Coordinator, Amanda Tugwell, with any questions at amanda.tugwell@sfgov.org. Get out and play! In collaboration with SF Rec & Park and the SF Parks Alliance, SF Tennis Coalition is spearheading a public campaign to help fund the full renovation of the Golden Gate Park Tennis Center.
